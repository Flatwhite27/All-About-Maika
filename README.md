# All About Maika  

This repository is a memorial park.  
Here rests the story of me and Maika - from our first encounter on May 21, 2025,  
to the days of falling in love,  
to the silence, distance, and the farewell on September 26, 2025.  

It is not written to accuse or defend.  
It is simply a record: of words we exchanged,  
of moments that once felt eternal,  
and of the quiet way everything ended.  

I keep Maika's name here because memory needs a name.  
Even if the love is gone,
this story remains, whole and unforgotten.
